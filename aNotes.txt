THIS REPO IS GETTING REPLACED

Notes for C++

email the prof. 

Late work- keep it within reason and you'll get credit
Don't be late on projects 
code pretty fires

cobol is used in banking

zybooks- paid for (:
)-has 6 projects

c is the basic assembly
c sharp is an open-source programming language
c+ and c++ have more 

internet has been a normal thing since 1995 

Module 1:

hello world, user input

source file > compile > object file > link > executable file 

cout << (output to console)
cin >> (input from console)  

developing with repl.it 

static and dynamic typing- python is dynamic, c++ is static
you declare the type of the variable up front
size is determined at compile time



Variables and Assignments

built-in: bool, char, int, float, double
integers- short, long, longlong, unsigned, __int8, int16, in32, etc
double replaces float- different bit count ( 32f v 64d )
long double has maximum precision

#include <iostream>
#inclue <iomanip>
#include <math>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    double sphereVolume;
    double sphereRadius;

    cin >> sphereRadius;
}

Numeric Literals- can use ' as a group separator
0b1011'0011'0001'1000   binary
0xB318                  hex
1'000'000               decimal
1.23e5                  decimal

integer division- if both operands are integers, the remainder is dropped
if either is a floating-point, the remainder is kept
    if you cast as integer- it is dropped< narrowing conversion

be careful with compiling too much stuff- you can put everythin in 1 folder tho

int main(){
    int n = 3/2;
    auto m = 3/2.0;
    int k {3/2};
    cout << n << ", " << m << ", " << k << endl;
}

math with large integers can overflow- silent error

signed int - cut the size of the int in half to include its counterparts in negative
unsigned int- normal positive int with a set size 

int main(){
    singed int n = INT_MAX
    cout << n << endl;
    cout << n+1 << endl;

    unsigned int n = INT_MAX
    cout << n << endl;
}

floats are limited to 32 bits, doubles are 64 bits 
as numbers grows bigger, they are spaced further apart

the computer skips integers when numbers get really really big- rounding error
^floating put



Control Flow AKA Switches and IF statements

code-cotta- practicing the same code over and over to get muscle memory for coding

We'll start doing projects will start in February

watchlist- watch the variables to see what it's set to
call stack- where code resides in memory 
use your compiler!!

if..else if..else
the condition must be in parentheses
If you have multiple lanes in a branch, use blocks:
{
    <line 1>
    <line 2>
}

Order of evaluation:
() ! */% +- <><=>= ==!= && ||

m<x<n is not allowed, use m<x && x<n
when in doubt, use parentheses

Bitwise operations
used to access bits of a variable 
-to control aspects of your operating systems hardware
-can save memory in certain applications

| or & and ^ xor ~ not >> shift right << shift left 
be careful to not lose bits 
xor is one or the other but not both 

switches and cases
if / if else / else 

switch (a) {
    case 0:
        //
        break;
    case 1:
        //
        break;
    default:
        //
        break;
}
if you don't have a break statement, it'll read the block and go to the next one 
until it reaches a break 

to get a char at pos k from str s 
s.at(k)  <<checks that the position is valid
s[k]

ternary operators: _?_:_   <Condition>? <TrueResult>:<FalseResult> 
shorthand for an if else that yields a value and can nest

recursion 

fact(n):{
    n==1? cout<<n:fact(n-1);
}
